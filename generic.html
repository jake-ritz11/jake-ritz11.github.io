									<h1>A little about myself</h1>
									<p>From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. 
										Growing up playing video games was what first sparked this interest. 
										I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked, and what else they could do. 
										The possibilities are endless. </p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Profile Picture BW.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Now as a Computer Scientist, I strive to apply my theoretical expertise to real-world problems in order to develop more efficient technologies. Gaining my Mathematics minor has helped me to improve my analytical and evaluative skills, giving me an insight into the richness that is Computer Science. I've used the knowledge that Ive gained over the past 4 years to develop programs that include everything from small-scale video game simulations to real-world problem-solving algorithms.</p>
								<p>I strive to refine and strengthen my skillsets. I am an individual that can adapt to any environment, possessing skills that reflect situational awareness, creativity, communication, and responsibility. I believe acquiring an engineering position in the video game industry would be mutually beneficial to both me and the company that offers me an opportunity. It would allow me to hone my current skills & learn new ones while the company would gain a focused, determined, and creative engineer.</p>
